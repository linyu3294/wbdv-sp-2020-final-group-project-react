CS5610 Final Project: Rent Match<br/>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to build, compile, and run Rent Match React/Redux/Java/MySQL Application

1. Run the middle-tier Java server with Heroku URL:
2. Run the React front-end with Heroku URL: 
3. You will arrive first at the Home Page. Feel free to take a look at the privacy policy page before using our platform. 
4. Click on the “Register” button and create a few users with the “Landlord” role. Initially, we had a data.sql file that would pre-populate the database with a few Landlord users (so that every listing had a dummy Landlord whose profile could be visited), but had issues with dependencies upon deployment.
5. From here, you can either sign out as a user and browse listings or other users’ profiles as either anonymous user, a renter, or a landlord, with custom content on each page depending on what role you are. If you are not logged in, you will not be able to access some pages.
6. If you “Like” a listing, you will have similar listings suggested to you and will be able to see listings you liked before. 
7. If you are a landlord, you can create listings which will populate in your Profile page which you can then edit.
For any listing that you choose to examine, you will see that listing from Streetview and aerial view as well. You will be able to see that listing’s landlord as well as other users who liked that listing.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
